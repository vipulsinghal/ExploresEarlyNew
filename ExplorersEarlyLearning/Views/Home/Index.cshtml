        <h1>why explorers early learning?</h1>
        <p>The early childhood years (birth to 6 yrs) are regarded as the foundation upon which a child’s life is constructed. From birth, young children develop socially, emotionally, cognitively and physically, acquiring the knowledge, skills and attitudes essential to their ongoing growth and development to adulthood.</p>
        <p>
            The children’s program at Explorers is developed by our early childhood trained staff and reflects our unique philosophy and commitment to the environment and our local community.

            <p>
                Children are seen as active participants in creating 
                    their own learning environment within a safe indoor/outdoor 
                    program that fosters their well-being and development.

                Families are the primary influence on their child’s 
                    learning and development. Children are given the opportunity to 
                    spend quality time with siblings, family and friends.

                Exploring the local community allows children to develop 
                    their sense of belonging. The Explorers community is enriched 
                    by celebrating and sharing similarities and differences.

                Children are encouraged to explore their inherent connection 
                    to nature, including dirt, sand and water.

            Knowing that every child is a unique tage, with individual 
                    needs for rest, food, love and learning, our educators will

            In the busy world of the toddler, there is so much to learn 
                    and explore. Our learning environments will create a safe space

                    environments.
